# nshrc
`nshrc` is a shell script file executed if you invoked nsh in the interactive
mode.

## File format
Unlike other shells it may have a special comments at the header:

```bash
### Generated by nshrc web editor (nsh-config)
### prompt=\{red}\{bold}[\{username}@\{hostname}]:\{reset} \{current_dir} $\{reset}
### path=/bin:/usr/bin:/usr/local/bin:/sbin

echo rc script follows
```

Header lines which starts with `###` is parsed by nsh *before* executing the scripts
in order to initialize the shell environment asynchronously: `$PATH` scanning and
prompt rendering.

### Format
```
/### (?<name>[a-zA-Z0-9_]+)=(?<content>.*)/
```
